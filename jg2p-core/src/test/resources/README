## real models on the full cmu dictionary
cmu_crfPT_2eps_32112 - this has the windows for -3, -2, -1, +1, +2 (with the width = to offset).  Using 2+eps alignments
cmu_crfAT_2ps.dat - this is the boundary predictor for cmu dict with 2x1 graphones and Xeps


## sample models for working with CmuSampleEval etc
cmu_crfAT_2eps - this is a crf model for predicting boundaries trained on whole CMU dict

pe_*.dat are phonetic encoder models serialized
am_*.dat are the align models serialized
lm_*.dat language model files

resources/am_cmubad2kA_A.dat - cmubad align model before any constrained allowed aligns
resources/am_cmubad2kA_aa_A.dat - first constrained align where we just use zeroes everything else
resources/am_cmubad2kA_aa_B.dat - second constrained align where we use discount smoothing to fill in

psaur_22_xeps_ww_GB_B1/G1.dat B1 is the "bad" training subset for cascading, G1 is the good
