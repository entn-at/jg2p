## real models on the full cmu dictionary
cmu_crfPT_2eps_32112 - this has the windows for -3, -2, -1, +1, +2 (with the width = to offset).  Using 2+eps alignments
cmu_crfAT_2ps.dat - this is the boundary predictor for cmu dict with 2x1 graphones and Xeps


## sample models for working with CmuSampleEval etc
cmu_crfAT_2eps - this is a crf model for predicting boundaries trained on whole CMU dict

pe_*.dat are phonetic encoder models serialized
am_*.dat are the align models serialized
lm_*.dat language model files
dt_*.dat/pmml reranking models (dt was originally decision tree but logistic regression is nicer)

resources/am_cmubad2kA_A.dat - cmubad align model before any constrained allowed aligns
resources/am_cmubad2kA_aa_A.dat - first constrained align where we just use zeroes everything else
resources/am_cmubad2kA_aa_B.dat - second constrained align where we use discount smoothing to fill in

psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_A.dat - A first cascade only 100, (G + B, B)
psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_B.dat - B second up to 200 (G + B, B)
psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_C.dat - third just the last little bit with (G + B, B)
psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_D.dat - first with (G, B)
psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_E.dat - first with AA + (G, B)
psaur_22_xeps_ww_GB_B1/G1.dat B1 is the "bad" training subset for cascading, G1 is the good
psaur_22_xeps_ww_f3_100.dat is the g+b crf phoneticEncoder pulled out of psaur_22_xeps_ww_CE_A that im going to use to start overfit testing
psaur_22_xeps_ww_f4_100.dat is the simple trainer, no cascades, no AA with f4 features for first 100 iterations
psaur_22_xeps_ww_f4B* - F4B features is the same as F4A except + surrounding(2,2) and surrounding_shape(3,3)
psaur_22_xeos_ww_f4C* - F4C features are F4 features + a few more surrounding char permutations

dt_reranker2_1.dat - this is the log reg RR model trained off the psaur_rerank_train_50k.txt file (with the 7 order LM)
dt_reranker2_2.dat - this is the log reg RR model trained off the psaur_rerank_train_50k_LM2.txt file (with the 2 order LM)
dt_reranker2_3.dat - logregRR, psaur_rerank_train_50k.txt, log xform of alignscore, GausPrior=3
dt_reranker2_4.dat - logregRR, psaur_rerank_train_50k.txt, log xform of alignscore, GausPrior=10
